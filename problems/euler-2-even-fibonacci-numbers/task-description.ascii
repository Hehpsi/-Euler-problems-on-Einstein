.Task
****
Create a file called euler-2-even-fibonacci-numbers.cpp

A fibonacchi sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms, starting with 1 and 2. The third term will thus be 1 + 2 = 3. The fourth term will be 2 + 3 = 5. The first 10 terms will be

  1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...

Your task is to calculate the sum of all even terms whose values do not exceed N. N should be passed to your program as a command line argument.

Upload your solution to https://euler.computing.dcu.ie/einstein/[_Einstein_].

.Example invocation
---
//1) compile the program. The flags will make the compiler //show additional error messages for easier debugging
$ c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror euler-2-even-fibonacci-numbers.cpp
//2) Run the program with command line argument N
./a.out N

.Example standard output
---
10

.Eplanation
***
The only even Fibonacci neumbers wich are less then 20 are 2 and 8, wich sum are 10
